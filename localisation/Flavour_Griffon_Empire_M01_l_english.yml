 griffon_empire_reform_desc:0 "After innumerable conquests, Marrhold has now forged an empire of its own, not in small part due to the effort of their griffon riders, who by now are an instrumental part of the Marrodic army, which enjoys an unprecedented level of royal sponsorship. Every marrodic soldier aspires to one day prove themselves and become a griffon lord in their own right, something which has led to a never-ending improvement of their technique."
